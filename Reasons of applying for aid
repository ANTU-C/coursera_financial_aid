Hello, my name is Antu Chowdhury and I live in Bangladesh, a country in development.
I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces 
because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition
at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in natural language processing, 
and I am searching for a job for a long time for earning money for taking this course, and I do not find yet, and the time goes on, 
receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and by taking it to allow to take off a paid internship and can take another 
course in the machine learning path. I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase 
my knowledge and advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully, this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, 
I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies,
and I'm eager to work and advance in my career.
