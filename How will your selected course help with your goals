I have a solid background in "math and algorithms and problem-solving skills", so I am eager to learn natural language processing
and that's the course's first step for me to make good projects that help humanity for an easy life and solve big problems. 
My main career goal is to learn every day, I really want to learn and progress in my career. NLP requires constant learning and improvement,
and taking a course can help me advance my knowledge. I plan on gaining additional skills by taking related classes and continuing my involvement
with a variety of professional associations I noticed that there are a lot of company provides internship and jobs in the related field, 
and I would certainly be interested in taking them and improving myself to be one of the pioneers of natural language processing. 
There are many opportunities in this field that the candidate can join but one must have good knowledge to join these opportunities, 
so I see that this course with good tutorials and exercises to join me in the world's largest companies and creativity in this area
